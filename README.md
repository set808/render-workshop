## Getting Started

To get started with the project in your local development environment, follow
these steps:

1. Create a codespace by selecting Code > Codespaces > Create codespace on main

2. Once you've loaded the codespace, in `newrelic.js` create an app name and add your New Relic license key.

3. Once you've updated `newrelic.js`, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You are now ready to go!
